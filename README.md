Rust Newbie Pitfalls
====================

Rust Sydney, June 2015

Viewing the slides
------------------

```
cd reveal.js
npm install
grunt serve # hit s in the browser to view speaker notes
```

or

open `reveal.js/index.html` in your browser (speaker notes won't work)

or

read `reveal.js/index.html` with a text editor and mentally add in the pretty pictures.

Note: this copy of reveal.js has a tweak to make the speaker notes use `white-space: pre-line` so that line breaks are preserved. Other than that, only `index.html` and `img/` + its contents are unique to this repo.
